# 1. Purpose  
This document serves as the central documentation hub for my long-term learning roadmap from a .NET developer to a future CTO.  
It provides structured navigation, classification, and access to all fundamental engineering knowledge, backend development, system architecture, fintech platforms, DevOps, and technical leadership materials.

---

# 2. Scope  
This documentation hub applies to:

- Core engineering foundations  
- C# & .NET fundamental programming  
- Backend & API development  
- Databases & data systems  
- System architecture & distributed systems  
- Fintech platform engineering  
- DevOps, cloud & security  
- CTO mindset & technical leadership  

It defines **how technical knowledge is structured, referenced, and continuously improved** throughout the learning journey.

# 3. Definitions  

**Engineering Foundations** — Core non-language-specific principles of software engineering and system design.  

**Backend Development** — Server-side application development using .NET and related technologies.  

**System Architecture** — High-level design of scalable, distributed, and secure software systems.  

**Fintech Platforms** — Digital wallet, payment, trading, and compliance systems.  

**CTO Roadmap** — Long-term technical and leadership growth path toward a Chief Technology Officer role.

**Future CTO** — Responsible for long-term technology strategy, platform scalability, and organizational technical leadership.

---

# 6. Controls & Learning Requirements  

This learning documentation is governed by the following control principles:

- Foundational knowledge must be learned before advanced frameworks.  
- Architecture reasoning must precede implementation decisions.  
- Security and scalability must be considered at all design stages.  
- All concepts must be backed by real technical projects.

This structure aligns conceptually with:

- ISO 27001 (Security & Governance Awareness)
- PCI-DSS (Secure Development Mindset)
- Enterprise Architecture Best Practices

---

# 7. References  

- Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)  
- Microsoft .NET Documentation  
- Domain-Driven Design (Eric Evans)  
- Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin)  
- Enterprise System Design Practices
